#  Employee Payroll Spring Boot Application

This project is a Spring Boot application designed to manage employee payroll data via RESTful APIs. It demonstrates building a multi-layered application (Controller, Service, Repository) and integrates with an H2 in-memory database.

---

##  Features

- **Employee Data Management**: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for employee payroll records.
- **In-Memory Data Persistence**: Uses H2 in-memory DB; data is volatile and stored in RAM.
- **H2 Console**: Web-based interface to inspect the in-memory database.
- **Structured API Design**: RESTful principles with clear, meaningful endpoints.
- **Layered Architecture**: Controller, Service, Repository separation.
- **DTO Pattern**: Clear contract for incoming request payloads.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Custom `EmployeeNotFoundException` for 404 Not Found scenarios.
- **Explicit Codebase**: Avoids Lombok for clear Java fundamentals â€” all methods are handwritten.
